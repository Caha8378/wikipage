            <h2>Nikola Jokić</h2>
            <p>Nikola Jokić (born February 19, 1995) is a Serbian professional basketball player, who is a center for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "the Joker," and hailed as one of the biggest draft steals in NBA history, he is regarded as one of the greatest players and centers of all time. A five-time NBA All-Star, he has been named to the All-NBA Team on five occasions (including three first-team selections), and won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons. He represents the Serbian national team with which he won a silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

                Jokić was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft. He was voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2016. In the 2018–19 NBA season, while leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Semifinals, he received his first All-Star and All-NBA First Team selections. The following season, he once again received All-Star and All-NBA honors, while leading his team to the Western Conference Finals. In the 2022–23 NBA season, he was awarded NBA Finals MVP after leading the Nuggets to their first-ever NBA championship. Jokić ranks among the top 10 on the all-time list of the NBA players with the most triple-doubles (regular season and playoffs), where he is the leading European player and center, and he holds the record for the fastest recorded triple double in NBA history (14m 35s).</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Jokić was born in the city of Sombor in the northern part of Serbia. He grew up in a cramped two-bedroom apartment that housed him and his two brothers, both parents and grandmother. His father was an agricultural engineer. Jokić developed a love of basketball early in his life playing with his two older brothers, Strahinja and Nemanja, who were a decade older. Both brothers played basketball in Serbia with Nemanja later playing college basketball for Detroit Mercy and C.W. Post and for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Steamers in the Premier Basketball League. The brothers are friends with former NBA player Darko Miličić. Jokić also loved horse racing as a child and competed as an amateur, a passion he still holds today.</p>

            <h2>2018-2019 Breakout Season</h2>
            <p>On July 9, 2018, Jokić signed a five-year, $148 million maximum contract extension with the Nuggets. On October 20, 2018, in the Nuggets' second game of the season, Jokić recorded 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a 119–91 win over the Phoenix Suns. He joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to post a triple-double with 30 or more points without missing a field goal—Chamberlain did it twice, in 1966 and 1967. He also became just the second Nugget to record a triple-double in the first two games of the season, joining Fat Lever. Jokić went on to earn Western Conference Player of the Week honors for the first week of the season, becoming the sixth player in franchise history to win the award three or more times, joining Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson and Chauncey Billups.[85] On November 3, he had a season-high 16 assists and 10 rebounds to go with seven points in a 103–88 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 9, he had a season-high 37 points and tied his career best with 21 rebounds in a 112–110 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. For his efforts in 2018, he was recognized as the Serbian Player of the Year by the Basketball Federation of Serbia.</p>

            <p>On July 1, 2022, Jokić agreed to a five-year $264 million supermax contract extension with the Nuggets, making it the richest deal in NBA history at the time of the signing. On November 3, Jokić put up 15 points, 13 rebounds, and 14 assists in a 122–110 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder; surpassing Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles all time by a center with 79.[200] On December 10, Jokić recorded his 80th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 rebounds, 14 assists and four blocks in a 115–110 win over the Utah Jazz.

On December 18, Jokić put up a triple-double with 40 points, a career-high 27 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 119–115 win over the Charlotte Hornets.

            <p>In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, Jokić posted a triple-double with 27 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds in a 104–93 win over the Miami Heat. He joined Jason Kidd as the only players in NBA history to put up a triple-double in their NBA Finals debuts.

He joined LeBron James and Larry Bird as the only players in NBA history to put up at least 500 points, 200 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single postseason run. He also became the first center in NBA history to put up at least 500 points and 100 assists in a single postseason run.[242][243] In Game 3, Jokić became the first player in NBA history to record 30+ points, 20+ rebounds and 10+ assists in a Finals game. He finished with 32 points, 21 rebounds and 10 assists, leading the Nuggets past the Heat in a 109–94 win. It was his 10th triple-double of this postseason. Jokić is also responsible for three of the five 30-point, 20-rebound and 10-assist playoff games ever, with two of those coming in these playoffs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain each have one. Jokić and Jamal Murray also became the first teammates in NBA history (regular season or playoffs) to record 30-point triple-doubles in the same game, with the latter also posting a 30-point triple-double in Game 3.[244] In Game 4, Jokić put up 23 points, 12 rebounds, four assists, three steals and three blocks in a 108–95 win over the Heat.

He was unanimously voted as Finals MVP and became the lowest draft pick in NBA history to win this award.[246][247] Jokić finished the NBA Finals averaging 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists and 1.4 blocks. He became the first player in NBA history to lead the entire postseason in total points (600), total rebounds (269) and total assists (186).</p>
